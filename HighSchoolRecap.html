        <a href="https://www.nhsd.org/high"> New Hope Solebury High School</a>
       <p>This is a high school located in New Hope, Pennsylvania. A beautiful little town just north of Philadelphia. 
         There are about 500 student body, 40+ staff. The school representative color is blue and yellow, mascow is a lion.
         NHS a great academic standing and wonderful music program. A big shout out to
         Mr. Bateman who is retiring this year, he has brought lots of delightful music and joy in this little school. He changes 
         the little heart who can go out and do great things. Another shout out to the cyber Web design class taught by Mr. McLuaghlin 
         is definetly worth taking. Even one specific student is always slacking, but Mr. McLaughlin is still rocking out.
